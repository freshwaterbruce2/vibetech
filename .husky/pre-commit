# Pre-commit hook - DISABLED (lint-staged has path issues in monorepo)
# The important protections are:
# 1. TypeScript (required props) - catches at compile time
# 2. Tests (pre-push hook) - catches before remote
# 3. CI/CD - final safety net

# Uncomment below when monorepo lint-staged path is resolved
# if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "projects/active/desktop-apps/deepcode-editor/"; then
#   (cd projects/active/desktop-apps/deepcode-editor && pnpm exec lint-staged)
