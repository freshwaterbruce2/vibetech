### For Developers

Even without Claude Desktop, these guides are valuable:

1. **Onboarding**: Read in order (1-6) to understand the monorepo
2. **Daily Work**: Keep COMMON_WORKFLOWS.md handy
3. **Code Reviews**: Use QUALITY_STANDARDS.md as checklist
4. **Debugging**: TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md for common issues
5. **Trading Bot**: Read TRADING_BOT_GUIDE.md before ANY changes

## 🚨 Critical Warnings

### Trading Bot Safety

The trading bot in `projects/crypto-enhanced/` trades with REAL MONEY:
- Current balance: ~$98.82 USD
- Actively trading: XLM/USD
- Read TRADING_BOT_GUIDE.md BEFORE making ANY changes
- When in doubt, ASK FIRST

### Security

NEVER commit:
- `.env` files
- API keys or secrets  
- Database credentials
- Trading bot configuration with real keys

All sensitive files are in `.gitignore`, but double-check before committing.
