## üéØ How to Use This Knowledge Base

### For Claude Desktop Users

These files are designed to be used with Claude Desktop's project knowledge feature:

1. **Add this directory to your project**:
   - Open Claude Desktop
   - Add the C:\dev directory as a project
   - Claude will automatically have access to these guides

2. **Claude will automatically reference these files**:
   - When working on web app features
   - When reviewing trading bot code
   - When troubleshooting issues
   - When answering architecture questions

3. **You can explicitly reference them**:
   - "Check the trading bot guide before changing that"
   - "What does the troubleshooting guide say about port conflicts?"
   - "Follow the quality standards for this PR"

### For Developers

Even without Claude Desktop, these guides are valuable:

1. **Onboarding**: Read in order (1-6) to understand the monorepo
2. **Daily Work**: Keep COMMON_WORKFLOWS.md handy
3. **Code Reviews**: Use QUALITY_STANDARDS.md as checklist
4. **Debugging**: TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md for common issues
5. **Trading Bot**: Read TRADING_BOT_GUIDE.md before ANY changes

## üö® Critical Warnings

### Trading Bot Safety

The trading bot in `projects/crypto-enhanced/` trades with REAL MONEY:
- Current balance: ~$98.82 USD
- Actively trading: XLM/USD
- Read TRADING_BOT_GUIDE.md BEFORE making ANY changes
- When in doubt, ASK FIRST

### Security

NEVER commit:
- `.env` files
- API keys or secrets  
- Database credentials
- Trading bot configuration with real keys

All sensitive files are in `.gitignore`, but double-check before committing.
