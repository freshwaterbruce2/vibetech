# Session Start Hook Implementation - Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Purpose:** Prevent repeating past mistakes by forcing learning database review

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Session-Start Hook (MANDATORY & BLOCKING)
**File:** `.claude/hooks/session-start.ps1`

**What it does:**
- Automatically runs at the start of EVERY Claude Code session
- Queries D:/learning/ for recent documents (last 30 days)
- Displays key lessons, action items, and root causes
- Shows current project test status
- **BLOCKS** session until you type 'yes' to acknowledge

**Why it's critical:**
- Forces review of past mistakes BEFORE starting work
- Can't bypass (blocking hook)
- No more "forgetting" to check learning DB
- Prevents repeating documented mistakes

### 2. Configuration
**File:** `.claude/settings.json`

Added SessionStart hook configuration:
```json
"hooks": {
  "SessionStart": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .claude/hooks/session-start.ps1",
          "timeout": 300
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Learning Database Query Script
**File:** `D:/learning/query-recent-lessons.ps1`

**Usage:**
```powershell
# Query all recent lessons
.\query-recent-lessons.ps1

# Search specific topic
.\query-recent-lessons.ps1 -Topic "deepcode"

# Last week only
.\query-recent-lessons.ps1 -Days 7
```

**What it extracts:**
- Executive summaries
- Lessons learned
- Action items
- Root causes
- Formatted for quick scanning

### 4. Updated CLAUDE.md
**File:** `projects/active/desktop-apps/deepcode-editor/CLAUDE.md`

Added mandatory session checklist section with:
- Hook enforcement documentation
- Key reminders from learning DB
- Forcing functions list
- Outcome-focused approach

## How It Works (Next Session)

### Step 1: Session Starts
Claude Code automatically triggers the SessionStart hook

### Step 2: Learning DB Display
```
==================================
SESSION INITIALIZATION REQUIRED
==================================

ðŸ“š Querying Learning Database...

ðŸ“– Recent learning documents (last 30 days):
   ðŸ“„ deepcode-editor-failure-analysis-2025-10-25.md
      Modified: 2025-10-25 14:30
      Key Points:
        Bottom Line: We were building code, not building products.
        RULE: Batch similar errors - don't fix one-by-one
        RULE: Measure outcomes, not activities
```

### Step 3: Test Status
```
ðŸ“Š Current Project Status...
   ðŸ“‹ Found: test_output.txt
      Tests: 372 failed | 1698 passed (82.0%)
```

### Step 4: Key Reminders
```
ðŸŽ¯ KEY REMINDERS FROM LEARNING DB:
   1. Query learning DB BEFORE starting (you're doing this now!)
   2. Batch similar errors - don't fix one-by-one
   3. Measure outcomes, not activities
   4. Test-first: Write failing test BEFORE implementation
   5. UI-first: If users can't see it, it doesn't exist
```

### Step 5: BLOCKING QUESTION
```
==================================
MANDATORY ACKNOWLEDGMENT
==================================

Have you reviewed the learning database and reminders above?
Type 'yes' to continue or 'no' to exit and review:

Your response: _
```

**If you type 'no':** Session BLOCKED until you re-run and type 'yes'
**If you type 'yes':** Session proceeds with full context

## Why This Solves The Problem

### Before (What Happened Today)
```
Session starts â†’ I code immediately
Learning DB exists but unused
Repeated documented mistakes
Fixed 2 tests in 45 minutes (one-by-one)
```

### After (With This Hook)
```
Session starts â†’ Hook forces DB review AUTOMATICALLY
Can't bypass (blocking)
See "batch similar errors" lesson
Would fix 20+ tests in 45 minutes
```

## The Meta-Problem It Solves

**The Issue:** "Even having a learning database doesn't help if you don't use it"

**The Solution:** Make it IMPOSSIBLE to not use it

**How:** Blocking hook at session start
- Can't start coding without reviewing
- Forces acknowledgment
- Patterns shown automatically
- No "forgetting" possible

## Testing The Implementation

### Manual Test (Next Session):
1. Start new Claude Code session
2. Hook should run automatically
3. Should see learning DB contents
4. Must acknowledge to proceed

### Verify Hook Installed:
```powershell
# Check hook file exists
Test-Path .claude/hooks/session-start.ps1

# Check settings.json has hook
cat .claude/settings.json | Select-String "SessionStart"
```

## Expected Impact

### Immediate:
- âœ… Learning DB reviewed every session (forced)
- âœ… Past mistakes visible before starting
- âœ… Patterns fresh in mind

### Long-term:
- âœ… Stop repeating documented mistakes
- âœ… Faster progress (batch fixes not one-by-one)
- âœ… Better outcomes focus
- âœ… Reduced rebuild cycles

## Files Created/Modified

**Created:**
1. `.claude/hooks/session-start.ps1` - The blocking hook script
2. `D:/learning/query-recent-lessons.ps1` - Query helper script
3. `.claude/SESSION-START-HOOK-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This file

**Modified:**
1. `.claude/settings.json` - Added SessionStart hook configuration
2. `projects/active/desktop-apps/deepcode-editor/CLAUDE.md` - Added mandatory checklist

**Backup:**
1. `.claude/settings.json.bak` - Backup of original settings

## Maintenance

### Weekly:
- Review D:/learning/ documents
- Update key reminders in hook if patterns change

### Monthly:
- Check hook still running (verify in session start)
- Update learning DB with new lessons
- Adjust reminder priorities

## Rollback (If Needed)

```powershell
# Restore original settings
Copy-Item .claude/settings.json.bak .claude/settings.json

# Remove hook
Remove-Item .claude/hooks/session-start.ps1

# Revert CLAUDE.md
git checkout projects/active/desktop-apps/deepcode-editor/CLAUDE.md
```

## Success Criteria

**Next Session:**
- [ ] Hook runs automatically at session start
- [ ] Learning DB contents displayed
- [ ] Must acknowledge to proceed
- [ ] Session has full context from past mistakes

**Next Month:**
- [ ] Zero repeated mistakes from learning DB
- [ ] Faster progress on similar tasks
- [ ] Reduced rebuild cycles
- [ ] Better outcome focus

---

**Remember:** This hook is a FORCING FUNCTION. It makes the right thing (reviewing learning DB) the ONLY thing you can do before starting work.

No more disasters from bypassing the learning system.
