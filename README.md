Of course. Your current README.md has a lot of great information, but its structure can be optimized for better clarity and developer experience. I've refactored it to be more organized, scannable, and aligned with modern best practices for monorepo documentation.

Here is the revised README.md. I've added comments `` to explain the key changes and improvements.
