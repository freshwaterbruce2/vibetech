# Git Index Lock File Solution (2025-10-24)

## Problem
Persistent `Unable to create '.git/index.lock': File exists` error that returns immediately after removing the lock file.

## Root Cause
- Git state corruption or multiple processes accessing the repository
- IDE integrations (VSCode, GitHub Desktop) watching the repository  
- Cloud sync services (Dropbox, OneDrive) interfering

## Solution That Worked
```bash
git fetch --prune && rm -f .git/index.lock && git commit
```

**Why it works:**
- `git fetch --prune` clears git's internal state and removes stale references
- This was the #1 recommended solution for 2025 based on web research
- More reliable than just removing the lock file alone

## Alternative Solutions (if above fails)
1. Close GitHub Desktop and IDE tools
2. Pause cloud sync software  
3. Check Task Manager for git.exe processes
4. Restart computer as last resort
