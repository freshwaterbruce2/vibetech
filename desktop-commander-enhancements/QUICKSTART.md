## What Just Happened?

The monitor script is now:
- âœ… Checking if your Python trading bot is running
- âœ… Watching your log files for errors in real-time
- âœ… Monitoring trade activity (alerts if no trades for 30+ min)
- âœ… Tracking memory/CPU usage
- âœ… Ready to send you toast notifications if something goes wrong

**You'll see output like:**
```
ðŸ¤– CRYPTO TRADING BOT HEALTH MONITOR

   â€¢ Check Interval: 60 seconds
   â€¢ No-Trade Alert: 30 minutes

## Next: Improve Your Daily Workflow (2 minutes)

Tomorrow morning, instead of manually:
1. Opening VS Code
2. Opening PowerShell

## Later: Validate Everything Works (10 minutes)

```

This will:
- Test keyboard/mouse automation

        Terminal  = @{ X = 1920; Y = 0; Width = 960; Height = 540 }
        # Adjust X, Y, Width, Height for your monitors
