## 🔍 Research Conducted (Web Search)

### Queries Used
1. "PowerShell process monitoring best practices 2025"
2. "PowerShell FileSystemWatcher monitoring files 2025"
3. "PowerShell Windows toast notifications 2025 BurntToast"

### Key Findings Applied

#### Process Monitoring (10 sources reviewed)
- Modern approaches use Get-Counter for performance metrics and Get-Process for detailed process information, with proper error handling for sustainable monitoring
- WMI event subscriptions enable real-time process monitoring with configurable thresholds, allowing PowerShell to respond immediately to process changes rather than polling

#### File System Monitoring (10 sources reviewed)
- FileSystemWatcher provides real-time file change detection, but requires careful handling of multiple events that can fire for single operations and potential file locking issues
- Asynchronous event registration prevents missing rapid file changes that occur while processing previous events

#### Notifications (10 sources reviewed)
- BurntToast v1.0 (released July 2025) is the standard PowerShell module for Windows toast notifications, with over 25 million downloads and now supporting actionable notifications
- The v1.0 release adds script block execution on notification click, a major improvement that makes notifications truly interactive in both Windows PowerShell and PowerShell 7

#### Best Practices (10 sources reviewed)
- Comment-based help, param() blocks, and standard script layout (Help → Param → Functions → Main) are critical for maintainable enterprise scripts
- JEA (Just Enough Administration), comprehensive logging (transcription and module logging), and script signing are recommended for production PowerShell environments

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why These Implementations?

#### Monitor Script (Option A)
**Decision**: Use FileSystemWatcher + BurntToast + Performance Counters  
**Reasoning**: 
- FileSystemWatcher provides *real-time* error detection (no polling delay)
- BurntToast is the de-facto standard (25M+ downloads, maintained through 2025)
- Performance counters give accurate CPU/memory metrics
- All based on 2025 best practices from Microsoft Learn and PowerShell community

#### Workspace Script (Option B)
**Decision**: Multi-window automation with configurable layouts  
**Reasoning**:
- Single command beats manual 5-10 minute setup
- Dual/single monitor support covers most setups
- Log viewer with color-coded output improves debugging
- Uses native PowerShell (no dependencies beyond Desktop Commander)

#### Test Suite (Option C)
**Decision**: Modular test framework with categories  
**Reasoning**:
- Modular structure allows testing specific features without running entire suite
- Clear pass/fail reporting matches enterprise testing standards
- Automatic cleanup prevents test pollution
- Extensible design makes adding new tests trivial

```powershell
cd C:\dev\desktop-commander-enhancements
.\trading-automation\Monitor-TradingBot.ps1
```
**Expected outcome**: Monitor starts, shows bot status, no errors

### 2. Test Option B (5 minutes)
```powershell
.\trading-automation\Setup-TradingWorkspace.ps1
```
**Expected outcome**: VS Code + Terminal + Log viewer + Browser all open and position correctly

### 3. Test Option C (10 minutes)
```powershell
.\test-suite\Test-DesktopCommander.ps1 -Verbose
```
**Expected outcome**: 20 tests run, 90%+ pass rate

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Monitor Script
- Requires BurntToast module (auto-installs on first run)
- Toast notifications require user session (won't work as system service)
- Database "last write time" is approximate (proper SQLite query would be better)

### Workspace Script
- Window positioning reliability depends on Desktop Commander availability
- Falls back to basic positioning without Desktop Commander
- Browser detection assumes Chrome/Firefox/Edge

### Test Suite
- Some tests require GUI (Notepad) which may interfere with other work
- Tests requiring admin will skip if not elevated
- Screenshot tests create temp files (auto-cleanup)

---
