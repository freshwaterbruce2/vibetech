# IMMEDIATE FIX - Icon Error

## Quick Fix (30 seconds)

You're already in the right directory! Just fix the config:

```powershell
# You're here (good!):
PS C:\dev\active-projects\desktop-commander-v2-fixed\desktop-commander>

# Open the config file in notepad:
notepad src-tauri\tauri.conf.json
```

Find this section:
```json
  "bundle": {
    "active": true,
    "targets": "all",
    "icon": [
      "icons/32x32.png",
      "icons/128x128.png",
      "icons/128x128@2x.png",
      "icons/icon.icns",
      "icons/icon.ico"
    ]
  }
```

Replace with:
```json
  "bundle": {
    "active": true,
    "targets": "all"
  }
```

**Save the file**, then:

```powershell
npm run tauri:dev
```

## What This Does

Removes the icon requirement. Tauri will use its default icon. The app works perfectly without custom icons!

## Alternative: Download Fixed Version

[Desktop Commander v2.0 Final (No Icons Required)](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/desktop-commander-v2-final.tar.gz)

This version has the fix already applied.

## After It Compiles

First compile takes 2-3 minutes. You'll see:
```
Compiling desktop-commander v2.0.0
...
Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2m 34s
```

Then the app launches automatically!
