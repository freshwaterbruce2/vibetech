## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Be Conversational:** Ask naturally, I'll figure out which tools to use
   - "How's my crypto bot?" vs "Execute get_crypto_status tool"

2. **Combine Queries:** Ask for multiple things at once
   - "Check crypto status and show me recent tasks"

3. **Use Project Names:** Mention projects explicitly for better filtering
   - "Show tasks for deepcode-editor"

4. **Save Often:** Save important work items for context
   - "Remember: need to fix the WebSocket disconnect issue"

5. **Morning Routine:** Start each day with a status check
   - "Good morning! Crypto status and what did I work on yesterday?"

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**"I don't see the tools"**
- Restart Claude Desktop completely (Quit from system tray)
- Wait 10 seconds, relaunch
- Check: `C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**"Database query failed"**
- Only SELECT queries allowed
- Check database path exists
- Try `get_database_summary` first to verify connection

**"Command execution timed out"**
- Long-running commands timeout at 30-60 seconds
- Use background execution for long tasks
- Check slash command scripts for errors

**"Memory bank is empty"**
- Start saving tasks: "Save this task: [description]"
- Memory persists in `C:\dev\projects\active\web-apps\memory-bank\quick-access\`
