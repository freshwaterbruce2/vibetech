## 📋 What Was Accomplished

### 1. Comprehensive Monorepo Review ✅
- Analyzed entire repository structure
- Assessed 8+ projects across multiple technologies
- Evaluated architecture, dependencies, build config, testing, security, and documentation
- Generated detailed 86.7/100 health score with actionable recommendations

**Output:** `MONOREPO_REVIEW.md` (comprehensive 500+ line analysis)

---

### 2. Security Hardening ✅
**Fixed:**
- Protected sensitive files (MY-API-KEYS.txt, COPY-PASTE-VARIABLES.txt)
