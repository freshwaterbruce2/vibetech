# WebSocket Timeout Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified

**Issue**: WebSocket connections timing out after 30 seconds  
**Root Cause**: The `asyncio.timeout(30)` context manager was wrapping the entire message handling loop, not just the connection/setup phase.

### What Was Happening

```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN):
async with asyncio.timeout(30):
    async with websockets.connect(url) as ws:
        await subscribe_to_channels()
        await handle_messages()  # ❌ Runs forever, timeout fires after 30s
```

The `handle_messages()` function runs indefinitely via `async for message in websocket:`, so the 30-second timeout would always fire even when the connection was healthy.

## Solution Applied

Restructured both `_connect_public()` and `_connect_private()` methods to only timeout the initial connection and subscription phases:

```python
# AFTER (FIXED):
async with asyncio.timeout(30):
    # PHASE 1: Connect (fast, ~2-5s)
    websocket = await websockets.connect(url)
    
    # PHASE 2: Subscribe (fast, ~1-3s)
    await subscribe_to_channels()
    
    # PHASE 3: Confirm with first message (max 10s)
    first_message = await asyncio.wait_for(ws.recv(), timeout=10.0)

# PHASE 4: Handle messages indefinitely (NO TIMEOUT) ✅
await handle_messages()
```

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `websocket_manager.py`:
  - `_connect_public()` - Restructured timeout handling
  - `_connect_private()` - Restructured timeout handling  
  - `_subscribe_public_channels()` - Added detailed logging
  - Exception handlers - Added proper WebSocket cleanup

### Improvements
1. **Proper Timeout Scope**: Only connection/authentication/subscription are timed out
2. **First Message Confirmation**: Verifies connection works before entering message loop
3. **Better Logging**: Shows exactly which phase is executing
4. **Cleaner Resource Management**: Explicit WebSocket close in all error paths
5. **Exponential Backoff**: Proper reconnection delays maintained

## Testing the Fix

### Quick Test (Recommended)
```bash
cd C:\dev\projects\crypto-enhanced
.venv\Scripts\activate
python tests\test_websocket_connection.py
```

This test script will:
1. ✅ Check network connectivity to Kraken
2. ✅ Test DNS resolution for WebSocket endpoints
3. ✅ Verify public WebSocket connection and data flow
4. ✅ Verify private WebSocket authentication (if credentials configured)

### Expected Output
```
=== Testing Network Connectivity ===
✅ Kraken API reachable (server time: 1728462000)
✅ DNS resolved Public WebSocket (ws.kraken.com) -> 104.18.x.x
✅ DNS resolved Private WebSocket (ws-auth.kraken.com) -> 104.18.x.x

=== Testing Public WebSocket ===
Public WebSocket connected successfully
✅ Received ticker data: XLM/USD

=== Testing Private WebSocket ===
Private WebSocket connected successfully
Private WebSocket authenticated
Private WebSocket subscriptions sent
✅ Private WebSocket confirmed

✅ ALL TESTS PASSED - WebSocket connections are working!
```

### Live Trading Test
After the test passes, start your trading bot:

```bash
cd C:\dev\projects\crypto-enhanced
.venv\Scripts\activate
python start_live_trading.py
```

Watch the logs for:
```
Public WebSocket connected successfully
Public WebSocket subscriptions sent
Public WebSocket confirmed (received: ticker)
Private WebSocket connected successfully
Private WebSocket authenticated
Private WebSocket subscriptions sent
Private WebSocket confirmed (received: executions)
```

## What to Monitor

### Good Signs ✅
- "WebSocket connected successfully" messages
- "WebSocket subscriptions sent" messages  
- "WebSocket confirmed" messages
- Ticker/execution data flowing in logs
- No timeout errors

### Bad Signs ❌
- "WebSocket setup timeout" errors (means connection/auth phase is slow)
- "WebSocket exception" errors (network issues)
- No data received after connection (subscription problems)

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist, the old code can be restored from git:
```bash
cd C:\dev\projects\crypto-enhanced
git checkout HEAD -- websocket_manager.py
```

## Additional Debugging

If the test still fails, enable DEBUG logging:

```python
# In .env file:
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

Then check logs for:
- Which phase is timing out (connection, auth, subscription, or confirmation)
- Network error messages
- Kraken API error responses

## Related Configuration

Ensure your `.env` has:
```env
KRAKEN_API_KEY=<your_key>
KRAKEN_API_SECRET=<your_secret>
TRADING_PAIRS=XLM/USD
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Run the test**: `python tests\test_websocket_connection.py`
2. ✅ **If test passes**: Start live trading with confidence
3. ❌ **If test fails**: Review error messages and check:
   - Internet connectivity
   - Firewall/proxy settings
   - API credentials validity
   - Kraken service status

## Technical Details

### Timeout Hierarchy
- **30s** - Connection + authentication + subscription phase
- **10s** - First message confirmation (within the 30s window)
- **No timeout** - Message handling loop (runs until stopped)

### Reconnection Logic
- Initial delay: 5 seconds
- Max delay: 60 seconds  
- Exponential backoff: delay *= 2 on each failure
- Rate limit: Max 150 connections per 10 minutes (Kraken limit)

### Error Recovery
All error paths now:
1. Log the error with full context
2. Close the WebSocket connection cleanly
3. Clear the connection reference (`self.public_ws = None`)
4. Wait with exponential backoff
5. Retry automatically
