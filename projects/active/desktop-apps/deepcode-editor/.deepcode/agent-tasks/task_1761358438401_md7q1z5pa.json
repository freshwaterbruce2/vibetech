This report should serve as a foundation for development decisions and improvements.\n2. Analysis: I'll recall key details from each file—README for project purpose, package.json for dependencies and scripts, source files for architecture and features, and tests for code quality—then organize them into the six requested sections.\n3. Structure: The report will follow a logical flow from high-level overview to technical details, ending with actionable recommendations. Markdown is ideal for readability and code integration.\n4. Verification: I'll cross-reference files to ensure accuracy, avoiding assumptions about unreferenced technologies.\n5.
