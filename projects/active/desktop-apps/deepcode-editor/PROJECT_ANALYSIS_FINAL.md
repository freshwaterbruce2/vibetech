## Critical Issues Found

### 1. TypeScript Compilation Errors (125 Total)

#### Missing Imports
- `logger` not imported in `AgentModeV2.tsx` (13 instances)
- Missing UI components: `radio-group`, `label`, `badge`
- Missing icon: `Balance` from lucide-react

#### Theme/Styling Issues
- Missing theme colors: `green`, `orange`, `red`, `danger`, `background`
- All references to these colors need fallback or theme update

#### File Casing Issues
- `Card.tsx` vs `card.tsx` causing Windows path conflicts
- TypeScript configuration sensitivity to case

#### Interface Mismatches
- `InlineCompletionsProvider` missing `disposeInlineCompletions` method
- `AIProviderManager` missing `initialize`, `configureProvider`, `setModel` methods
- `ElectronService` missing `minimizeWindow`, `maximizeWindow`, `closeWindow`
- `CodeContext` type mismatches

#### Type Errors
- Unreachable code in `Editor.tsx` and `ExecutionEngine.ts`
- Wrong function signatures (argument count mismatches)
- Missing required props (`onShowSettings` in EditorPage)

### 2. Incomplete/Placeholder Code

#### Test Files with Placeholders
All new test files created have `expect(true).toBe(true)` placeholders:
- `DatabaseService.test.ts` - All tests are placeholders
- `BackgroundWorker.test.ts` - All tests are placeholders
- `CustomRulesEngine.test.ts` - All tests are placeholders
- `DependencyAnalyzer.test.ts` - All tests are placeholders
- `ApprovalDialog.test.tsx` - Partially implemented
- `GlobalSearch.test.tsx` - Partially implemented
- `BackgroundTaskPanel.test.tsx` - All tests are placeholders
- `CompletionIndicator.test.tsx` - All tests are placeholders
- `EnhancedAgentMode.test.tsx` - All tests are placeholders
- `TerminalService.test.ts` - All tests are placeholders
- `LanguageServer.test.ts` - All tests are placeholders

**Action Required**: Replace 98 placeholder tests with real implementations

#### Missing Components
Based on TypeScript errors, these components referenced but not fully implemented:
- `radio-group` UI component
- `label` UI component
- `badge` UI component
- Balance icon (use alternative from lucide-react)

- No task queue visualization

### 4. Production Build Issues

#### No Packaging Configuration

## Architecture Review

### Current Architecture: ✅ Good (Modular)

```
src/
├── components/          # UI Components (React)
│   ├── AgentMode/      # Multi-agent UI
│   ├── ErrorBoundary/  # Error handling
│   ├── settings/       # Settings panels
│   └── ui/             # Reusable UI primitives
├── services/           # Business Logic
│   ├── ai/            # AI integration
│   │   ├── completion/  # Auto-completion
│   │   └── specialized-agents/  # Agent system
│   ├── FileSystemService.ts
│   ├── DatabaseService.ts
│   └── ...
├── hooks/             # React hooks
├── types/             # TypeScript types
├── utils/             # Utilities
└── styles/            # Themes & styles
```

**Assessment**: Architecture is well-organized and modular. No major refactoring needed.

### Recommendations
- ✅ Keep current structure
- Add `/features` folder for feature-specific bundles (code splitting)
- Add `/config` folder for environment configs
- Separate `electron/` more clearly from `src/`

---

## 2025 Best Practices Compliance

### ✅ Following Best Practices
- React 19 with concurrent features
- TypeScript strict mode (when it compiles)
- Monaco Editor integration
- Vite for fast builds
- Modular architecture
- Component composition
- Styled-components for theming

### ❌ Not Following Best Practices
- No proper error boundaries everywhere
- Missing accessibility (ARIA) attributes
- No internationalization (i18n)
- No proper logging/monitoring
- Missing proper state management (considering Zustand or Jotai)
- No CI/CD pipeline defined
- No automated releases

---

## Security Audit

### ✅ Good Security Practices
- API keys encrypted (AES-256)
- Secure storage (SecureApiKeyManager)
- No secrets in code

### ⚠️ Security Concerns
- No Content Security Policy (CSP) defined
- Node integration enabled in Electron (security risk)
- No input sanitization on AI responses
- Missing dependency vulnerability scanning
- No SAST/DAST testing

### Required Actions
1. Implement CSP headers
2. Disable Node integration, use contextBridge only
3. Add input sanitization library (DOMPurify)
4. Set up Snyk or Dependabot
5. Add security testing to CI/CD

---

## Performance Analysis

### Bundle Size (Estimated)
- **Current**: ~15-20MB (unoptimized)
- **Target**: <5MB (with code splitting)

### Load Time
- **Current**: ~3-5 seconds (development)
- **Target**: <2 seconds (production)

### Memory Usage
- **Current**: ~150-200MB idle
- **Target**: <100MB idle

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Code Splitting**: Load Monaco lazily
2. **Tree Shaking**: Remove unused dependencies
3. **Image Optimization**: Compress assets
4. **Lazy Loading**: Load features on demand
5. **Worker Threads**: Move heavy processing off main thread
6. **Virtual Scrolling**: Already implemented in file tree
