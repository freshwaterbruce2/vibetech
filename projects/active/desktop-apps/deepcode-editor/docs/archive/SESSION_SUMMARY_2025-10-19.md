## 📊 LOG ANALYSIS RESULTS

### Console Log Review:
✅ **Working**:
- Task persistence (no forbidden errors)
- Multi-step execution (8/8 steps completed)
- DeepSeek API integration
- Auto-file creation
- Workspace indexing (18 files)

⚠️ **Monaco Worker Errors** (NON-CRITICAL):
- 100+ "Unexpected usage" errors from Monaco workers
- Root cause: Vite dev server serving workers with wrong MIME type
- **Impact**: Console spam only, does NOT affect agent functionality
- **Decision**: Accepted as cosmetic issue for now
