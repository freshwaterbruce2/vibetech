# Agent Mode Skipped Steps Visibility Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Phase:** 1 of 6 (Agent Mode 2025 Enhancement)
**Issue:** Skipped steps shown as "completed" (green), making failures invisible
**Solution:** Added visual distinction for skipped steps with orange styling and separate tracking

## Problem

When agent mode couldn't complete a step (e.g., file not found), it would:
- ❌ Mark step as "skipped" internally
- ❌ Display step with green checkmark (looks like success)
- ❌ Count skipped steps as "completed"
- ❌ Show "Task Completed" even though steps failed

**Example:**
```
Task: Review JSON Configuration Files
Step 1: Search for JSON files ✅ (green - actually completed)
Step 2: Read tsconfig.json ✅ (green - ACTUALLY SKIPPED!)
Step 3: Read package.json ✅ (green - actually completed)
Progress: 3 / 3 steps completed ← LIE! Only 2 completed
```

## Solution

### Visual Changes:
1. **Orange styling for skipped steps**
   - Border: `#fb923c` (orange)
   - Background: `rgba(251, 146, 60, 0.08)` (light orange)
   - Icon: AlertTriangle (warning symbol)

2. **Separate progress tracking**
   - Before: "3 / 3 steps completed"
   - After: "2 completed, 1 skipped / 3 total"

3. **Console logging**
   - Logs skip reason: `[AgentModeV2] Step was skipped: Read tsconfig.json Reason: File not found`

## Changes Made

### File: `src/components/AgentMode/AgentModeV2.tsx`

**1. Added skipped state tracking (Line 476)**
```typescript
const [skippedSteps, setSkippedSteps] = useState(0);
```

**2. Updated StepCard styling (Lines 206-230)**
```typescript
border: 2px solid ${props => {
  switch (props.$status) {
    case 'skipped': return '#fb923c'; // Orange for skipped
    // ...
  }
}};
background: ${props => {
  switch (props.$status) {
    case 'skipped': return 'rgba(251, 146, 60, 0.08)';
    // ...
  }
}};
```

**3. Updated StepNumber styling (Lines 239-260)**
```typescript
background: ${props => {
  switch (props.$status) {
    case 'skipped': return '#fb923c'; // Orange circle
    // ...
  }
}};
```

**4. Added skip icon (Lines 666-681)**
```typescript
case 'skipped':
  return <AlertTriangle />; // Warning icon for skipped steps
```

**5. Track skipped vs completed (Lines 531-549)**
```typescript
onStepComplete: (step, result) => {
  if (step.status === 'skipped' || result.skipped) {
    setSkippedSteps(prev => prev + 1);
    console.log('[AgentModeV2] Step was skipped:', step.title, 'Reason:', result.message);
  } else {
    setCompletedSteps(prev => prev + 1);
  }
  // ...
}
```

**6. Updated progress display (Lines 735-740)**
```typescript
<ProgressText>
  {completedSteps} completed
  {skippedSteps > 0 && `, ${skippedSteps} skipped`}
  {' / '}{currentTask.steps.length} total
  {estimatedTime && ` • Est. ${estimatedTime}`}
</ProgressText>
```

**7. Reset skip count on new task (Line 1065)**
```typescript
setSkippedSteps(0); // Reset skipped count too
```

## How It Looks Now

### Before Fix:
```
Task: Review JSON Configuration Files
✅ Step 1: Search for JSON files (green)
✅ Step 2: Read tsconfig.json (green - looks completed!)
✅ Step 3: Read package.json (green)
Progress: 3 / 3 steps completed
Status: ✅ Completed
```

### After Fix:
```
Task: Review JSON Configuration Files
✅ Step 1: Search for JSON files (green)
⚠️  Step 2: Read tsconfig.json (orange - clearly skipped!)
✅ Step 3: Read package.json (green)
Progress: 2 completed, 1 skipped / 3 total
Status: ✅ Completed (with warning visible)
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Transparency**: User can see which steps were skipped
2. **Accurate Progress**: Progress bar shows true completion vs skipped
3. **Visual Distinction**: Orange clearly different from green/red
4. **Debugging**: Console logs explain why steps were skipped
5. **Informed Decisions**: User knows task is "complete" but incomplete

## Status Colors Summary

| Status | Border Color | Background | Icon | Meaning |
|--------|-------------|------------|------|---------|
| Pending | Surface | Surface | Number | Not started |
| In Progress | Purple | Purple 8% | Spinner | Currently executing |
| Completed | Green | Green 5% | CheckCircle | Successfully done |
| Failed | Red | Red 5% | XCircle | Error occurred |
| **Skipped** | **Orange** | **Orange 8%** | **AlertTriangle** | **Could not complete** |
| Awaiting Approval | Yellow | Yellow 8% | Shield | Needs user approval |

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. **Create test task that will skip steps:**
   ```
   Task: Read tsconfig.json, package.json, and non-existent.json
   ```

2. **Expected behavior:**
   - tsconfig.json (if missing): Orange with AlertTriangle
   - package.json: Green with CheckCircle
   - non-existent.json: Orange with AlertTriangle
   - Progress: "1 completed, 2 skipped / 3 total"

3. **Console should show:**
   ```
   [AgentModeV2] Step was skipped: Read tsconfig.json Reason: File not found
   [AgentModeV2] Step was skipped: Read non-existent.json Reason: File not found
   ```

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

Now that users can SEE skipped steps, Phase 2 will make the agent HANDLE them better:
- Instead of skip → retry with different strategies
- Ask AI assistant for help when stuck
- Create missing files intelligently
- Provide fallback options

**Testing Checklist:**
- [x] Skipped steps show orange border
- [x] Skipped steps show AlertTriangle icon
- [x] Progress shows "X completed, Y skipped / Z total"
- [x] Console logs skip reason
- [x] "New Task" resets skip count
- [x] Skipped steps visually distinct from completed

**Status:** ✅ Complete - Skipped steps now visible!
