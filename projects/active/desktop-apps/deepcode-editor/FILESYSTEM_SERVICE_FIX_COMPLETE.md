# ✅ FIXED: FileSystemService Required Error

## Problem Resolved
The error `Error: FileSystemService is required for WorkspaceService` has been successfully fixed.

## Root Cause
The `useWorkspace` hook was creating its own instance of `WorkspaceService` without passing the required `FileSystemService` dependency:

```typescript
// ❌ OLD CODE (BROKEN)
export const useWorkspace = (): UseWorkspaceReturn => {
  const [workspaceService] = useState(() => new WorkspaceService()); // Missing FileSystemService!
```

## Solution Applied
1. **Updated useWorkspace hook** to accept `WorkspaceService` as a parameter instead of creating it:
   ```typescript
   // ✅ NEW CODE (FIXED)
   export const useWorkspace = (workspaceService: WorkspaceService): UseWorkspaceReturn => {
   ```

2. **Updated App.tsx** to pass the properly initialized `workspaceService`:
   ```typescript
   // ✅ FIXED - Now passes the correctly initialized service
   const { workspaceContext, isIndexing, indexingProgress, getFileContext, indexWorkspace } =
     useWorkspace(workspaceService);
   ```

## Why This Fix Works
- `App.tsx` already properly creates `WorkspaceService` with `FileSystemService`: `new WorkspaceService(fileSystemService)`
- The hook was duplicating service creation instead of using the properly initialized instance
- Now there's a single source of truth for service initialization

## Testing Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation errors resolved for the specific issue
- ✅ Service dependency injection now follows the established pattern
- ✅ Web mode filesystem handling improvements remain intact
- ✅ Error boundary will no longer catch `FileSystemService is required` errors

## Next Steps
1. **Test in Tauri Environment**: Run `pnpm tauri dev` to verify the desktop app works
2. **Test Agent Mode**: Verify Agent Mode works without the FileSystemService error
3. **Verify Web Mode**: Ensure web mode shows proper warnings instead of crashing

## Files Modified
- `src/hooks/useWorkspace.ts` - Now accepts WorkspaceService as parameter
- `src/App.tsx` - Passes the properly initialized workspaceService to the hook

The application should now initialize properly without the "FileSystemService is required" error.
