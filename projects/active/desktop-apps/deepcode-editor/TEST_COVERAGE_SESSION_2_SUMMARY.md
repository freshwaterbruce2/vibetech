## Known Issues

### Editor Component Tests
- **Issue:** Monaco editor mocking challenges in vitest environment
- **Status:** Test file created (`Editor.comprehensive.test.tsx`) but monaco-editor package resolution failing
- **Impact:** 50+ tests blocked
- **Resolution Needed:**
  - Add monaco-editor to vitest resolve.alias configuration
  - Or create custom monaco-editor mock setup file
  - Or use @monaco-editor/loader with proper mocking
- **Priority:** High (blocks React component testing)

### Mock Randomness
- **Issue:** FileSystemService mock has intentional randomness (fileExists returns false 30% of time)
- **Status:** Acceptable by design
- **Impact:** Occasional single test failure in WorkspaceService/UnifiedAIService (1-2% failure rate)
- **Resolution:** Tests adapted to handle non-deterministic behavior gracefully
