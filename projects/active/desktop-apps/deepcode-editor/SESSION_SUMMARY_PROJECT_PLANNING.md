5. **Commit often** - Small, atomic commits

### Development Approach
1. **TDD for hard stuff** - Write tests first for complex features
2. **Keep it modular** - Don't create mega-files
3. **Follow patterns** - Look at existing code
4. **Ask before major changes** - Architecture is good, keep it
5. **Use web search** - For 2025 best practices

### Time Management
1. **Focus on critical path** - Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3
2. **Don't optimize early** - Phase 4 only

## 💬 Notes for Personal Project

### Remember This Is Your Personal Project

**What This Means**:
- You're building this for yourself first
- No external deadlines or pressure
- Can work at your own pace
- Can adjust scope as you go
- Focus on learning and enjoying the process

**Flexibility**:
- Timeline is a guide, not a requirement
- Can take breaks when needed
- Can defer features if losing interest
- Can release "good enough" version
- Can iterate based on your own usage

**Success = Useful to You**:
- If YOU can use it daily → Success
- If it saves YOU time → Success
- If YOU learned something → Success
- Don't compare to commercial tools
- Celebrate YOUR progress

**Realistic Expectations**:
- Won't compete with VS Code (that's okay!)
- Won't have all features of Cursor (that's fine!)
- Will be YOUR custom tool (that's the point!)
- Will be a learning experience (valuable!)

### Recommended Approach

1. **Fix compilation first** - Must compile to be useful
2. **Get core features working** - Editor + AI completions
3. **Use it yourself** - Test with real work
4. **Iterate based on your needs** - Add what you miss
5. **Share when ready** - Or keep it private, your choice

**Remember**: Done is better than perfect. Ship v1.0, then improve.
