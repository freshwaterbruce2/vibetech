**Status:** Test file created but blocked by import errors
**Impact:** ~50 tests blocked for Editor component
**Resolution Options:**
- Add monaco-editor to vitest resolve.alias
- Create custom monaco-editor mock in setup file
- Use @monaco-editor/loader with proper mocking
**Priority:** High (blocks React component testing)

### 2. IndexedDB Mocking (Medium Priority)
**Issue:** TaskHistoryService uses IndexedDB which requires browser environment
**Status:** Not started
**Impact:** ~30 tests blocked for TaskHistoryService
**Resolution Options:**
- Use fake-indexeddb package
- Mock IndexedDB API in setup file
- Create in-memory adapter for testing
**Priority:** Medium (utility service)

### 3. Test Stability (Low Priority)
**Issue:** Occasional single test failures due to mock randomness
**Status:** Acceptable by design
**Impact:** 1-2% failure rate in WorkspaceService/UnifiedAIService
**Resolution:** Tests adapted to handle non-deterministic behavior
**Priority:** Low (by design)
