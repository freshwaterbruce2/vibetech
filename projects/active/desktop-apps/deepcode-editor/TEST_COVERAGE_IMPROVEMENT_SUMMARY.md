## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Run new tests individually** to verify all pass:
   ```bash
   pnpm test -- src/__tests__/services/ai/TaskPlanner.test.ts
   pnpm test -- src/__tests__/services/ai/ExecutionEngine.test.ts
   pnpm test -- src/__tests__/services/specialized-agents/AgentOrchestrator.comprehensive.test.ts
   ```

2. **Fix existing test failures** (30 failing test files):
   - Priority: ErrorBoundary, Editor, Integration tests
   - These are pre-existing issues, not related to new tests

3. **Generate coverage report**:
   ```bash
   pnpm test -- --coverage
   # View HTML report at coverage/index.html
   ```

### Quality Assurance

1. **Code Review** new test suites for:
   - Test clarity and maintainability
   - Mock accuracy
   - Assertion completeness
   - Edge case coverage

2. **CI/CD Integration:**
   - Add coverage thresholds to prevent regression
   - Gate merges on critical path coverage (Agent Mode: 85%+)
   - Generate coverage badges

3. **Documentation:**
   - Add test running instructions to README
   - Document testing patterns and conventions
   - Create testing guide for new contributors

### Long-Term Strategy

1. **Incremental Coverage Improvement:**
   - Add tests with each new feature
   - Require tests for bug fixes
   - Target 80%+ overall coverage by end of Q1 2025

2. **Test Maintenance:**
   - Review and update tests quarterly
   - Refactor tests alongside production code
   - Remove obsolete tests

3. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Identify and optimize slow tests
   - Parallelize test execution where possible
   - Use test coverage caching
