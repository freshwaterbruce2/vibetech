## ‚ùå PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED

### Problem 1: Monaco Editor Worker Errors (HIGH FREQUENCY)
**Location**: Multiple Monaco worker files
**Error Pattern**:
```javascript
editorSimpleWorker.js:501 Uncaught (in promise) Error: Unexpected usage
    at EditorSimpleWorker.loadForeignModule (editorSimpleWorker.js:501:31)

Failed to load module script: The server responded with a non-JavaScript MIME type of "text/html"
```

**Severity**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium (Not breaking agent functionality, but cluttering console)

**Root Cause**: Monaco editor trying to load TypeScript/JavaScript worker modules as ES modules, but Vite is serving them incorrectly

**Affected Files**:
- `editorSimpleWorker.js:501`
- `tsMode.js:414`
- `errors.js:15`

**Impact**:
- Console spam (100+ errors)
- Potential TypeScript IntelliSense issues
- Inlay hints and code actions may not work

---

### Problem 2: Self-Correction Not Tested
**Location**: ExecutionEngine.ts (Phase 2 code)

**Issue**: All tasks succeeded, so self-correction logic never triggered:
```
ExecutionEngine.ts:547 [ExecutionEngine] ‚úì Auto-created file: C:/dev/opcode/vite.config.ts
```

**Why This Happened**:
- Auto-file creation is TOO good
- Steps that should fail are succeeding
- Need intentional failure to test self-correction

**Severity**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium (Code exists but untested in production)

---

### Problem 3: Workspace Context Empty
**Location**: UnifiedAIService.ts:310-311

**Evidence**:
```
UnifiedAIService.ts:310 [UnifiedAI] Workspace summary length: 91 chars
UnifiedAIService.ts:311 [UnifiedAI] Summary preview: Workspace contains 0 files across 0 languages...
```

**But later**:
```
WorkspaceService.ts:88 Workspace indexing completed. Indexed 18 files
```

**Root Cause**: Workspace indexing happens AFTER AI calls, so initial context is empty

**Severity**: üü° Low (Works eventually, but initial responses lack context)

---

## üîç DETAILED PROBLEM BREAKDOWN

### Problem 1 Analysis: Monaco Worker Module Loading

**Technical Details**:
The Monaco editor is configured to use web workers for TypeScript language features. The workers are being loaded as ES modules (`?worker_file&type=module`), but Vite's dev server is returning HTML instead of JavaScript.

**Stack Trace Pattern**:
```
EditorSimpleWorker.loadForeignModule (editorSimpleWorker.js:501)
  ‚Üí webWorker.js:38
  ‚Üí tsMode.js:84 (TypeScript mode worker)
  ‚Üí WorkerManager.getLanguageServiceWorker (tsMode.js:90)
  ‚Üí DiagnosticsAdapter._doValidate (tsMode.js:380)
```

**Triggered By**:
- File opens in editor
- TypeScript validation
- IntelliSense requests
- Inlay hints
- Code actions

**Frequency**: Every time a TypeScript file is edited or opened

---

## üõ†Ô∏è RECOMMENDED FIXES

### Fix 1: Monaco Worker Configuration (PRIORITY)

**File**: `src/components/Editor.tsx` (around line 600)

**Current Code**:
```typescript
[Editor] Monaco workers configured successfully
```

**Problem**: Workers are configured, but Vite isn't serving them correctly

**Solution**: Update Vite config to handle Monaco workers properly

---

### Fix 2: Add Self-Correction Test Scenario

**Create**: New test that will DEFINITELY fail

**Test Task**: "Read the file at Z:/this/drive/does/not/exist/missing.txt"
- Z: drive doesn't exist on most Windows systems
- Will trigger file not found
- Should trigger self-correction

---

### Fix 3: Pre-index Workspace Before Agent Tasks

**File**: `src/services/ai/ExecutionEngine.ts`

**Change**: Index workspace BEFORE starting task execution

---

## üìä SEVERITY MATRIX

| Problem | Severity | Frequency | User Impact | Agent Impact |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Monaco Worker Errors | Medium | Very High (100+/session) | Console spam | None - agent works |
| Self-Correction Untested | Medium | Low (only during testing) | None | Unknown reliability |
| Empty Workspace Context | Low | High (every first task) | Suboptimal responses | Recovers after indexing |

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING PERFECTLY

1. **Tauri Permissions** - No forbidden path errors ‚úÖ
2. **Task Persistence** - Saving to `.deepcode/agent-tasks/` ‚úÖ
3. **Multi-Step Execution** - 8/8 steps completed ‚úÖ
4. **Auto-File Creation** - Creates missing files with AI ‚úÖ
5. **DeepSeek API** - API calls working, responses valid ‚úÖ
6. **Workspace Indexing** - Eventually indexes 18 files ‚úÖ

---

## üéØ ACTION PLAN

### Phase A: Fix Monaco Workers (Critical for Clean Logs)
1. Research latest Monaco + Vite configuration (web search)
2. Update `vite.config.ts` with correct worker handling
3. Test in dev mode
4. Verify errors gone

### Phase B: Test Self-Correction (Validation)
1. Create deliberate failure test
2. Execute in Agent Mode
3. Verify self-correction triggers
4. Document behavior

### Phase C: Optimize Workspace Context (Enhancement)
1. Pre-index workspace on app load
2. Cache indexing results
3. Reduce AI response time for first task

---

## üìù NOTES

- All Phase 1 & 2 code is WORKING
- Tauri permission fix is SUCCESSFUL
- Main issue is Monaco editor configuration (not agent-related)
- Self-correction code exists but needs runtime validation
- Overall system health: **GOOD** ‚úÖ
