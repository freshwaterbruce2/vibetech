  "title": "Fixed Desktop Commander Enhanced MCP Server Version Mismatch",

  "context": {
    "project": "Desktop Commander Enhanced MCP Server",
    "issue_type": "Version synchronization and configuration",
    "severity": "medium",
    "impact": "MCP server tools not reflecting latest code changes"
  },

  "problem_statement": "Desktop Commander Enhanced was running v0.2.14 while package.json showed v0.2.16. Rebuild appeared successful but version mismatch persisted. MCP server required proper version sync and Claude Desktop restart to apply changes.",

  "investigation": [
    "Read claude_desktop_config.json to verify configuration",
    "Checked MCP server logs for version information",
    "Discovered version.ts had hardcoded v0.2.14",
    "Found package.json showed v0.2.16",
    "Identified need for version synchronization"
  ],

  "resolution_steps": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "action": "Sync version across all files",
      "command": "npm run sync-version",
      "result": "Version 0.2.16 synchronized across package.json, server.json, and version.ts"
    },
    {
      "step": 2,
      "action": "Rebuild TypeScript with updated version",
      "command": "npm run build",
      "result": "Successfully compiled 262 TypeScript files in 3.96s"
    },
    {
      "step": 3,
      "action": "Restart Claude Desktop",
      "method": "Complete quit from system tray",
      "result": "MCP server reloaded with v0.2.16"
    },
    {
      "step": 4,
      "action": "Verify version in logs",
      "command": "tail -100 logs/mcp-server-desktop-commander-enhanced.log | grep version",
      "result": "Confirmed: serverInfo.version = 0.2.16"
    }
  ],

  "key_learnings": [
    "MCP servers only reload when Claude Desktop starts - window close is insufficient",
    "Version must be synced with npm run sync-version before building",
    "Windows requires full path to npx.cmd in MCP configuration",
    "Claude Desktop has hard 60-second timeout for MCP operations (not configurable)",
    "Always verify version in logs after MCP server updates"
  ],

  "troubleshooting_checklist": [
    "Check version.ts vs package.json mismatch",
    "Run npm run sync-version if versions differ",
    "Rebuild with npm run build",
    "Verify dist/version.js shows correct version",
    "Complete quit of Claude Desktop (not window close)",
    "Wait 10 seconds before relaunch",
