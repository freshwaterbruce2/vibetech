# Agent Orchestrator System - NOW ACTIVE

**Status:** ✅ LIVE AND OPERATIONAL
**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Command:** "ok put them to work"

## System Status: ACTIVE

The Agent Orchestrator System is now fully integrated into Claude Code and actively monitoring all incoming tasks. Specialist agents will be automatically invoked based on learned patterns from 4,362 proven executions.

## What's Running Now

### 1. User Prompt Hook (ACTIVE)
**File:** `.claude/hooks/user-prompt-submit.ps1`

**What It Does:**
- Monitors every task you submit to Claude Code
- Analyzes task keywords and project context
- Calls Python orchestrator for agent recommendation
- Auto-invokes specialist agents when confidence >= 3.0
- Displays reasoning and performance metrics

**Triggers On:**
- Tasks (implement, create, build, develop, write, add, modify, update)
- Errors (fix, debug, error, exception, fail, broken, bug, issue)
- Complex requests (complexity score >= 3)

**Example Flow:**
```
You: "Fix the WebSocket connection error in crypto trading"
       ↓
Hook analyzes: keywords [fix, websocket, crypto, trading], project [crypto-enhanced]
       ↓
Orchestrator calculates: confidence 14.99
       ↓
System displays:
  SPECIALIST AGENT RECOMMENDATION

    - crypto_auto_fixer
    - enhanced_market_001

  Reasons:
    - Inherited from 4 proven performers
    - Proven track record with auto_fix_cycle tasks (2954 executions)
    - Assigned specialist for crypto-enhanced

    Execution Time: 0.17s

  AUTO-INVOKING SPECIALIST (confidence >= 3.0)

Specialist agent recommended: @crypto-expert
This agent has proven expertise with this type of task.
```

### 2. Session Start Hook (ENHANCED)
**File:** `.claude/hooks/session-start.ps1`

**What It Shows:**
- Current project and assigned specialist agent
- Inherited patterns and execution history
- Performance targets (99.96% success rate)
- Orchestrator status: "Agent Orchestrator Ready"

**Example Display:**
```
================================================================================
  CLAUDE CODE MEMORY SYSTEM - PHASE 1.5
================================================================================

CONTEXT: crypto-enhanced | Specialist Agent: @crypto-expert is available
         Crypto Trading Expert - Anti-Duplication & Performance-First Design
         Inherited from 4362 proven executions (99.96% success)

CURRENT CONTEXT
----------------
  Branch        : main
  Working Dir   : C:\dev\projects\crypto-enhanced
  Modified Files: 5

STATUS: Memory System Active | Auto-save enabled | Agent Orchestrator Ready
        Specialists will auto-invoke based on task analysis (confidence >= 3.0)
================================================================================
```

### 3. Agent Orchestrator Engine (RUNNING)
**File:** `C:\dev\projects\active\web-apps\memory-bank\agent_orchestrator.py`

**Algorithm:**
```
For each task:
1. Extract keywords (crypto, trading, react, component, api, etc.)
2. Detect task type (fix, monitor, analyze, refactor)
3. Check project context (crypto-enhanced, digital-content-builder, etc.)
4. Calculate confidence:
   - Base: keyword matches (1 point each)
   - Boost: inherited performance (success_rate * 2)
   - Boost: task type match (success * 3)
   - Boost: project assignment (3 points)
5. If confidence >= 3.0 → AUTO-INVOKE
6. Display reasoning and performance targets
```

**Specialist Routing:**
- crypto-expert: trading, crypto, kraken, websocket, order, market, nonce
- webapp-expert: react, component, ui, tailwind, shadcn, vite, router
- backend-expert: api, database, server, auth, rest, graphql
- desktop-expert: tauri, electron, desktop, window, native
- mobile-expert: capacitor, android, ios, mobile, app
- devops-expert: docker, deploy, ci, cd, pipeline, github actions

## How to Use

### Automatic (Recommended)
Just describe your task naturally. The system will:
1. Analyze your request
2. Select the best specialist
3. Display reasoning and metrics
4. Auto-invoke if confidence is high

**Examples:**
```
You: "Fix the WebSocket error in crypto trading"
→ Auto-invokes @crypto-expert (confidence 14.99)

You: "Create a new dashboard component"
→ Auto-invokes @webapp-expert (confidence 11.99)

You: "Optimize the database queries"
→ Auto-invokes @backend-expert (confidence 12.3)
```

### Manual Override
If you want to explicitly use a specialist:
```
@crypto-expert Fix the trading system
@webapp-expert Create dashboard component
@backend-expert Optimize database
```

### Check Recommendations (Testing)
```powershell
# Test orchestrator
cd C:\dev\projects\active\web-apps\memory-bank
python agent_orchestrator.py "Your task description" "project-name"

# Test with PowerShell
.\.claude\hooks\invoke-specialist-agent.ps1 `
  -TaskDescription "Your task" `
  -ProjectContext "project-name" `
  -DryRun
```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Daily
The system runs automatically:

- Auto-invokes specialists based on confidence
- Logs recommendations (implicit)

### Weekly (Optional)
```powershell
# Re-extract patterns from latest data
cd C:\dev\projects\active\web-apps\memory-bank
python migrate_agent_patterns.py

# Review effectiveness
cat training_summary.txt
```

### Monthly (Optional)
```powershell
# Full retraining
python train_agents.py --all

# Check orchestrator decisions
# Review which specialists got invoked and why
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No recommendation showing
**Cause:** Task doesn't contain triggering keywords or complexity too low

**Check:**
- Is this actually a task? (implement, create, fix, debug, etc.)
- Does it have error indicators? (error, exception, fail, bug)
- Is complexity >= 3?

**Solution:** Add more descriptive keywords or manually invoke with `@agent-name`

### Issue: Wrong specialist recommended
**Cause:** Keywords match multiple specialists

**Solution:**
- Add project-specific keywords
- Specify project in working directory
- Manually override with `@correct-agent`

### Issue: Orchestrator not responding
**Check:**
1. Python installed and in PATH
2. Orchestrator file exists: `C:\dev\projects\active\web-apps\memory-bank\agent_orchestrator.py`
3. Pattern mapping exists: `agent_pattern_mapping.json`
4. Agents config exists: `.claude\agents.json`

**Quick fix:**
```powershell
# Re-run pattern extraction
cd C:\dev\projects\active\web-apps\memory-bank
python migrate_agent_patterns.py
```
