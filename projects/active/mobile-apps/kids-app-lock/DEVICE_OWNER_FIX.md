# Fixing the "Can Exit with Home Button" Issue

**Issue:** After selecting single app lock, pressing the circle/home button exits the app.

**Root Cause:** App has Device Admin (weak) but NOT Device Owner (strong).

---

## Understanding the Difference

### Device Admin (What You Have Now)
- ✅ Easy to set up (app prompts you)
- ✅ No factory reset required
- ❌ Can be bypassed with home/back buttons
- ❌ Status bar can be pulled down
- ❌ Not truly locked
- **Good for:** Testing only, not production use

### Device Owner (What You Need)
- ✅ Unbreakable kiosk mode
- ✅ Home/back/recents buttons disabled
- ✅ Status bar hidden
- ✅ Cannot bypass without PIN
- ❌ Requires factory reset to set up
- ❌ More complex setup process
- **Good for:** Production use, actual child safety

---

## Your Current Status

```
Device Admin: ✅ YES (enabled)
Device Owner: ❌ NO (not set)
Lock Mode:    ⚠️ WEAK (can be bypassed)
```

**What this means:**
- Single App Lock mode is NOT truly locked
- Whitelist mode will NOT work
- Blacklist mode will NOT work effectively

---

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Set Device Owner (Strongest Security)

**For unbreakable kiosk mode**

**Requirements:**
- ⚠️ Factory reset required
- ⚠️ Loses ALL device data
- ⚠️ Cannot have Google account added
- ✅ Best for dedicated kid's device

**Steps:**

1. **Backup all device data**
   - Photos, contacts, apps, everything!
   - This will WIPE the device

2. **Factory reset device**
   - Settings → System → Reset → Factory data reset
   - OR hold Power + Volume Down during boot

3. **Initial setup (CRITICAL)**
   - ⚠️ **Skip Google account setup** (most important!)
   - Connect to WiFi
   - Skip all optional setups

4. **Enable USB debugging**
   - Settings → About Phone
   - Tap "Build number" 7 times
   - Back → Developer Options
   - Enable USB debugging
   - Connect to computer via USB

5. **Set Device Owner via ADB**
   ```bash
   # Check no accounts exist
   adb shell dumpsys account

   # Should show NO accounts! If it shows accounts, factory reset didn't work

   # Set Device Owner
   adb shell dpm set-device-owner com.kidesafe.applock/.admin.KioskDeviceAdminReceiver

   # Expected output:
   # Success: Device owner set to package com.kidesafe.applock
   ```

6. **Verify Device Owner**
   ```bash
   adb shell dpm list-owners

   # Expected:
   # Device Owner: com.kidesafe.applock
   ```

7. **Reinstall app if needed**
   ```bash
   cd C:\dev\projects\active\mobile-apps\kids-app-lock\android
   ./gradlew installDebug
   ```

8. **Test again**
   - Open app
   - Select Single App Lock
   - Choose an app
   - Try pressing home button → Should NOT work!

**Time:** 30-45 minutes (mostly waiting for reset)

---

### Option 2: Use Blacklist Mode Instead (Your Original Need!)

**For blocking specific apps without full lockdown**

**No factory reset required!**

**Why this is better for your use case:**
- ✅ No factory reset needed
- ✅ Device works normally
- ✅ Just blocks specific apps
- ✅ Less invasive for your son
- ⚠️ Requires completing the monitoring service

**Current status:**
- UI works ✅
- App selection saves ✅
- Active blocking needs implementation ⏳

**What I can do next:**
- Implement AccessibilityService to detect app launches
- Create overlay window to block prohibited apps
- Add background monitoring service

**Time to implement:** 1-2 hours

---

### Option 3: Accept Device Admin Limitations

**For testing/casual use only**

**What you can do:**
- Use the app in current state
- Understand it's not truly locked
- Use honor system with your son
- Suitable for younger kids who won't know how to bypass

**Time:** 0 minutes (already done)

---

## Recommended Path for Your Use Case

**Goal:** Keep your son OUT of certain apps

**Best Solution:** Option 2 (Blacklist Mode)

**Why:**
1. No factory reset required
2. Device functions normally
3. Just blocks specific apps (TikTok, Instagram, games)
4. Less restrictive than full kiosk mode
5. Age-appropriate for a son (vs toddler lockdown)

**What happens next:**
1. I implement the blacklist monitoring service (1-2 hours)
2. You test it on device
3. It actively blocks apps in real-time
4. Your son can use everything EXCEPT blocked apps

---

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommended Option |
|----------|-------------------|
| Dedicated kid's device (ages 2-6) | Option 1 (Device Owner) |
| Blocking specific apps (ages 7-17) | Option 2 (Blacklist Mode) |
| Just testing the app | Option 3 (Accept limitations) |
| **Your use case (son, block apps)** | **Option 2 (Blacklist Mode)** |

---

## What to Do Right Now

**I recommend Option 2 - Let me implement blacklist monitoring.**

**Your choice:**

**Option A: "Implement blacklist monitoring"**
→ I'll complete the AccessibilityService and app blocking
→ No factory reset needed
→ 1-2 hours implementation time
→ Perfect for your use case

**Option B: "Set up Device Owner"**
→ I'll guide you through factory reset
→ Unbreakable kiosk mode
→ 30-45 minutes setup time
→ Better for dedicated kid device

**Option C: "Use a different approach"**
→ Digital Wellbeing (built into Android)
→ Google Family Link
→ Third-party apps from Play Store

---

## Testing Device Owner Without Factory Reset (Advanced)

**For developers only - requires ADB root access**

If your device is rooted or using emulator:
```bash
# Remove all accounts first
adb shell pm list users  # Note user IDs
adb shell pm remove-user [user-id]

# Then set Device Owner
adb shell dpm set-device-owner com.kidesafe.applock/.admin.KioskDeviceAdminReceiver
```

**Note:** Most consumer devices are NOT rooted, so factory reset is required.

---

## Summary

**Current Issue:**
- Home button bypasses single app lock
- Device Admin is too weak

**Root Cause:**
- Not set as Device Owner

**Solutions:**
1. Factory reset + Device Owner setup (strongest)
2. Implement blacklist monitoring (best for you)
3. Accept limitations (testing only)

**My recommendation:**
Let me implement blacklist monitoring service (Option 2) - it's perfect for your needs and doesn't require factory reset!
