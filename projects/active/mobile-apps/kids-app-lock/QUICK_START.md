# Quick Start - Testing Kid's App Lock

**Goal:** Get the app running on your device in under 5 minutes

---

## Option 1: Automated Testing (Easiest)

**Single command to build, install, and launch:**

```powershell
cd C:\dev\projects\active\mobile-apps\kids-app-lock
.\test-on-device.ps1
```

**What it does:**
1. ‚úÖ Checks ADB is installed
2. ‚úÖ Verifies device is connected
3. ‚úÖ Builds debug APK
4. ‚úÖ Installs to device
5. ‚úÖ Launches app
6. ‚úÖ Offers to show live logs

**Time:** 2-3 minutes

---

## Option 2: Manual Testing (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Connect Device

1. Connect Android device via USB
2. Enable USB debugging:
   - Settings ‚Üí About Phone
   - Tap "Build number" 7 times
   - Back ‚Üí Developer Options
   - Enable "USB debugging"
3. Tap "Allow" when prompted on device

### Step 2: Verify Connection

```bash
adb devices
# Expected: List of devices attached
#           ABC123456789    device
```

### Step 3: Build and Install

```bash
cd C:\dev\projects\active\mobile-apps\kids-app-lock\android
./gradlew installDebug
```

**Expected output:** `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`

### Step 4: Launch App

```bash
adb shell am start -n com.kidesafe.applock/.MainActivity
```

**Time:** 3-5 minutes

---

## What to Test

### Test 1: Single App Lock (5 minutes)
‚úÖ **Works TODAY** - Fully functional

1. Complete onboarding (set PIN)
2. Grant permissions
3. Select "Single App Lock" mode
4. Pick ONE app (e.g., Clock)
5. Tap "Lock to This App"

**Expected:** Device locked to that app, cannot exit without PIN

---

### Test 2: Block Selected Apps (5 minutes)
‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL** - UI works, monitoring needs work

1. Select "Block Selected Apps" mode
2. Pick apps to block (e.g., games, social media)
3. Tap "Block These Apps"

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Apps selected and saved
- ‚úÖ Red color coding shows
- ‚ùå Active blocking doesn't work yet (monitoring service needed)

---

### Test 3: Whitelist (5 minutes)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Requires Device Owner** - May need factory reset

1. Check if Device Owner set:
   ```bash
   adb shell dpm list-owners
   ```

2. If NOT set (most likely):
   - Skip this test for now
   - Requires factory reset to enable
   - Not needed for your use case anyway

3. If IS set:
   - Select "Allow Only Selected" mode
   - Pick multiple apps
   - Tap "Allow Only These Apps"

**Expected:** Can only use selected apps

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No devices found"
**Solution:**
1. Check USB cable is data cable (not charging-only)
2. Try different USB port
3. On device: Settings ‚Üí Developer Options ‚Üí Revoke USB authorizations ‚Üí Reconnect

### "Build failed"
**Solution:**
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### "Installation failed"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Uninstall old version
adb uninstall com.kidesafe.applock

# Reinstall
./gradlew installDebug
```

### "App crashes on launch"
**Solution:**
```bash
# View crash logs
adb logcat | grep -E "AndroidRuntime|FATAL"
```

## Your Use Case: Blocking Apps

**Goal:** Keep son out of certain apps

**Best Mode:** Block Selected Apps (Mode 3)

**Quick Setup:**
1. Run automated test script: `.\test-on-device.ps1`
2. Complete onboarding
3. Select "Block Selected Apps"
4. Choose apps to block (TikTok, Instagram, games)
5. Tap "Block These Apps"

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ UI works perfectly
- ‚úÖ App selections save correctly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Active blocking needs monitoring service
- ‚è≥ Coming next: Background monitoring to actually block apps

**Workaround (Until Monitoring Complete):**
- Use "Allow Only Selected" mode instead
- Select all SAFE apps your son CAN use
- Everything else is automatically blocked
- Requires Device Owner setup (factory reset)

---

## Next Steps

**After Testing:**

1. ‚úÖ **Working Modes:**
   - Single App Lock ‚Üí Ready for production
   - Whitelist ‚Üí Ready (if Device Owner set)

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Completion:**
   - Blacklist monitoring service
   - Accessibility Service for app detection
   - Overlay window to block launches

3. üìã **Future Enhancements:**
   - Unit tests
   - Time limits
   - Scheduled mode switching
   - Usage reports
