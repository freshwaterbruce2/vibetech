## Device Information

**Model:** Samsung Galaxy
**Android Version:** Unknown (Modern - supports InsetsController API 30+)
**Screen Resolution:** 1080 x 2340 (FHD+)
**Display Cutout:** Present (notch/hole punch)
**Rounded Corners:** Yes (113px radius)
**Navigation:** 3-button navigation (135px bottom inset)

---

## Known Limitations (Expected)

### Device Owner Not Set
**Status:** ⚠️ Expected
**Impact:** Kiosk mode will use basic Device Administrator
**Solution:** Run Device Owner setup command

```bash
adb shell dpm set-device-owner com.kidesafe.applock/.admin.KioskDeviceAdminReceiver
```

**Note:** This requires factory-reset device with no Google account

### Test Environment Constraints
- Cannot automate screenshot capture (ADB shell limitations)
- Cannot automate UI interactions without UI Automator framework
- Manual testing required to validate Jetpack Compose UI
- Cannot test PIN lockout (requires 30-second wait)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Manual UI Testing** - Test complete onboarding flow on physical device
2. **Permission Granting** - Grant Device Admin and Usage Stats permissions
3. **App Selection Test** - Select a test app (e.g., Calculator)
4. **Kiosk Mode Test** - Attempt to start kiosk mode (will have limited security without Device Owner)

### Device Owner Setup (Optional for Full Testing)
If you have a factory-reset device:
```bash
# 1. Check current device owner status
adb shell dpm list-owners

# 2. Set Device Owner (only works on clean device)
adb shell dpm set-device-owner com.kidesafe.applock/.admin.KioskDeviceAdminReceiver

# 3. Verify
adb shell dpm list-owners
# Expected: Device Owner: com.kidesafe.applock
```

### Advanced Testing (Phase 2)
- PIN recovery via security question
- Lockout after 5 failed attempts (30 seconds)
- Boot persistence (if enabled)
- System UI hiding effectiveness
- Lock task mode security (requires Device Owner)

## Automated Test Commands

To reproduce these tests:

```bash
# Reinstall app
cd C:/dev/projects/active/mobile-apps/kids-app-lock/android
./gradlew installDebug

# Launch app
adb shell am start -n com.kidesafe.applock/.MainActivity

# Monitor logs
adb logcat -s "MainActivity:*" "KioskManager:*" "SecurityManager:*"

# Check app is running
