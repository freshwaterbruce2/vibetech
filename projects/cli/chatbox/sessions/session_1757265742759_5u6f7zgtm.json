      "content": "It looks like you're trying to run a Node.js file called `test-security.cjs`. However, I can't actually execute files on your system. \n\nIf you're having issues running this file, here are some common troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. **Make sure you're in the correct directory:**\n   ```bash\n   ls -la\n   # Look for test-security.cjs in the output\n   ```\n\n2. **Check if the file exists and has the right permissions:**\n   ```bash\n   ls -la test-security.cjs\n   ```\n\n3. **Try running it with the full node command:**\n   ```bash\n   node test-security.cjs\n   ```\n\n4. **If you're getting permission errors:**\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x test-security.cjs\n   ```\n\n5. **Check your Node.js version:**\n   ```bash\n   node --version\n   ```\n\nIf you're still having issues, could you share:\n- The error message you're seeing (if any)\n- The contents of the `test-security.cjs` file\n- Your operating system and Node.js version\n\nThis would help me provide more specific guidance!",
