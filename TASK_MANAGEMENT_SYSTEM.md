## NOVA Agent Integration

This task management system is designed to work seamlessly with NOVA Agent's AI capabilities:

### Quick NOVA Commands
```bash
# Get AI-powered insights
"Show me what I worked on yesterday"           # Activity history analysis
"What should I work on next?"                  # Priority suggestions based on patterns
"How long will this take?"                     # Time estimates from similar past tasks
"Analyze my focus time this week"              # Deep work tracking
"What's blocking my progress?"                 # Automatic blocker detection
```

### AI-Powered Features
- **Automatic Time Tracking**: NOVA monitors your actual work time vs estimates
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learns when you're most productive for different task types
- **Smart Suggestions**: Recommends next steps based on project context
- **Focus Protection**: Detects context switches and suggests consolidation

## Outcome-Based Goals (Not Task Lists)

### This Week's Target Outcomes
- [ ] **Deploy automation enhancements** with zero rollback required
- [ ] **Increase test coverage from 65% to 80%** in critical paths
- [ ] **Reduce build time from 8min to 4min** through optimization
- [ ] **Ship 3 customer-requested features** with full documentation

**Success Metrics:**
- Zero critical production incidents
- <5% error rate in monitoring
- All deployments complete within SLA
- Team velocity increases by 20%

### This Month's Strategic Objectives
- [ ] **Establish CI/CD foundation** - 100% automated deployments
- [ ] **Performance optimization** - 50% improvement in key metrics
- [ ] **Security hardening** - Pass security audit with zero high-severity findings
- [ ] **Technical debt reduction** - 30% reduction in code complexity metrics

## Task Categories by Impact

### High Leverage (Do These First)
Tasks that directly contribute to outcomes and have multiplier effects:
- [ ] Automate repetitive deployment steps (saves 5+ hours/week)
- [ ] Implement critical test coverage gaps (prevents production issues)
- [ ] Optimize slow build pipeline bottlenecks (unblocks entire team)

### Medium Leverage (Schedule Intentionally)
Important but not urgent, or moderate impact:
- [ ] Refactor complex code sections
- [ ] Update documentation for recent features
- [ ] Investigate new tooling options

### Low Leverage (Batch or Delegate)
Necessary but low-impact tasks:
- [ ] Code cleanup and formatting
- [ ] Routine dependency updates
- [ ] Administrative tasks

### Learning & Growth
Invest in skills that compound over time:
- [ ] Study new testing frameworks
- [ ] Experiment with performance optimization techniques
- [ ] Contribute to open source projects

## Deep Work Scheduling (Cal Newport Method)

### Focus Time Blocks (Schedule Based on Your Peak Energy)

**Deep Work Block 1**: 2.5 hours of uninterrupted focus
- Best for: Architecture design, complex problem-solving, creative coding
- Rules: No notifications, no email, no meetings
- Environment: Headphones, closed door, "Do Not Disturb" mode

**Deep Work Block 2**: 2 hours of sustained concentration
- Best for: Writing technical specs, debugging complex issues, code reviews
- Rules: Single task focus, no context switching
- Environment: Minimal distractions, clear desk

**Shallow Work Window**: 1-2 hours for necessary administrative tasks
- Tasks: Email responses, meeting attendance, Slack catch-up, admin work
- Strategy: Batch these together, don't let them interrupt deep work

### Energy Management (Not Time Management)

**High Energy Tasks** (Your peak 2-4 hours):
- Creative architecture decisions
- Complex algorithm implementation
- Writing technical documentation
- Learning new technologies

**Medium Energy Tasks** (Moderate focus required):
- Code reviews
- Testing and debugging
- Pair programming sessions
- Refactoring existing code

**Low Energy Tasks** (Can do when tired):
- Routine dependency updates
- Email and communication responses
- Attending informational meetings
- File organization and cleanup

## Capacity Planning & Burnout Prevention

### Weekly Capacity Overview
```
Total Available Hours: 40 hours/week
- Deep Work Target: 15-20 hours (37-50%)
- Shallow Work: 10-15 hours (25-37%)
- Meetings & Collaboration: 5-10 hours (12-25%)
- Buffer/Contingency: 5 hours (12%)
```

### Health Indicators
Track these to maintain sustainable pace:

**Green Flags (Healthy):**
- [ ] Total committed hours: <40/week
- [ ] Deep work hours: 15-20/week
- [ ] Meeting load: <20% of total time
- [ ] Weekend work: 0 hours
- [ ] Consecutive workdays: <10 without break

**Yellow Flags (Warning):**
- [ ] Total committed hours: 40-50/week
- [ ] Deep work hours: <12/week (too many interruptions)
- [ ] Meeting load: 20-30% of time
- [ ] Weekend work: 1-4 hours
- [ ] Feeling rushed or overwhelmed

**Red Flags (Take Action):**
- [ ] Total committed hours: >50/week
- [ ] Deep work hours: <8/week (constant context switching)
- [ ] Meeting load: >30% of time
- [ ] Weekend work: >4 hours regularly
- [ ] Physical symptoms: fatigue, poor sleep, anxiety

**If Red Flags Appear:**
1. Cancel or delegate non-critical tasks
2. Block off recovery time in calendar
3. Discuss workload with team/manager
4. Review and adjust commitments

## Progress Tracking & Retrospectives

### Daily Reflection (5 minutes at end of day)
- What was my highest-leverage work today?
- Did I protect my deep work time?
- What unexpected blockers appeared?
- What did I learn?

### Weekly Retrospective (30 minutes on Friday)
**What Went Well:**
- List 3 wins from this week
- What processes worked effectively?
- What outcomes did we achieve?

**What Didn't Go Well:**
- What blocked progress?
- What tasks took longer than expected?
- What could we have done differently?

**What to Try Next Week:**
- 1-3 small experiments to improve workflow
- New tools, processes, or approaches
- Learning goals

**Key Metrics:**
- Completed outcomes vs planned outcomes
- Deep work hours achieved
- Build/deployment success rate
- Production incident count

## Quick Commands & Workflows

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start work session
pnpm run dev                    # Start development servers

# Quality checks before commit
pnpm run quality                # Full pipeline: lint + typecheck + build
pnpm run quality:fix            # Auto-fix issues

# Testing
pnpm run test                   # Run test suite
pnpm run test:unit:coverage     # Check coverage

# Monorepo operations
pnpm run build:all              # Build all projects (Nx cached)
pnpm run quality:affected       # Only check changed projects
pnpm nx graph                   # Visualize dependencies
```

### NOVA Agent Queries

# Activity analysis
"Show me my activity from this morning"
"How much focus time did I get today?"

# Task suggestions
"What should I work on next based on priorities?"
"Which tasks are blocking other work?"

# Time estimation
"How long will optimizing the build take?"
"When can I realistically finish this sprint?"
