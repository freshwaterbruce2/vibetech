## Usage Examples

### Daily Workflow
```bash
# Morning: Check what changed overnight
/nx:affected-smart

# Before commit: Safety check
/crypto:pre-deploy-check

# Weekly: Performance review
/perf:report
```

### Investigation Workflow
```bash
# Slow build?
/perf:build-compare
/nx:cache-stats

# Large bundle?
/perf:bundle-analyze iconforge

# Slow session start?
/perf:hook-profile 7
```

### Code Review Workflow
```bash
# Review trading logic changes
@risk-analyzer please review strategies.py changes

# Check dependency changes
/nx:dep-analyze --circular
```

## Testing Checklist

To validate Phase 2:
- [ ] Verify marketplace.json is valid JSON
- [ ] Check all command files are readable
- [ ] Test nx commands with real workspace
- [ ] Run crypto safety check on trading system
- [ ] Generate sample performance reports
- [ ] Invoke risk-analyzer agent
- [ ] Verify all command documentation is clear

## What's Next: Phase 3 - Hook Optimization (Week 2-3)

**Estimated Time:** 6 hours  
**Goals:**
1. Implement async session-start pattern (2h)
2. Add smart hook triggering (2h)
3. Create performance monitoring (1h)
4. Validate improvements (1h)

**Expected Impact:**
- Session start: 387ms → <100ms (74% faster)
- Prompt overhead: 247ms → <50ms (80% faster)
- Better developer experience

## Integration Points

### With Phase 1 (Configuration)
- Plugins respect permissions in settings.json
- Commands use environment variables from config
- Status line shows plugin-related metrics

### With Phase 3 (Hook Optimization)
- perf:hook-profile will measure Phase 3 improvements
- Performance monitoring validates optimization efforts

### With Phase 4 (Nx Cloud)
- nx:cache-stats will show Cloud hit rates
- nx:affected-smart will benefit from Cloud intelligence

---

## Notes

- All plugins use `strict: false` (no plugin.json required)
- Commands are self-documenting (markdown format)
- Agent uses proven risk analysis patterns
- Performance profiling is non-intrusive
- All commands provide actionable recommendations

**Phase 2 Complete! Ready for Phase 3 when you're ready.**

Total Development Time So Far: ~2.5 hours (Phase 1 + Phase 2)
Remaining: Phases 3-5 (~18 hours estimated)
