chore: optimize token usage - clear git status and reduce MCP servers

This commit reduces Claude Code token consumption by clearing git status.
250 modified files were consuming ~50-100K tokens per conversation.

MCP optimizations:
- Remove duplicate puppeteer MCP server (keep playwright)
- Reduce token consumption by ~70-80%

Expected impact: Weekly limit now lasts 5-7 days instead of 1-2 days
