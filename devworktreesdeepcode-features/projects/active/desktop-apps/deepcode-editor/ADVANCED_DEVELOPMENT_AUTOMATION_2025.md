## Multi-Agent Development Workflows

### Orchestration Patterns

**Agentic AI Systems**: The most significant trend in 2025 is the emergence of agentic AI systems that demonstrate autonomous capabilities across various domains. Unlike traditional AI models that respond to prompts, these systems can:

- **Intelligent Planning**: Higher-level LLMs generate comprehensive plans and assign tasks to specialized sub-agents
- **Parallel Execution**: Automatically parallelize steps that can be done concurrently while blocking on dependencies
- **Result Synthesis**: Combine outputs from multiple agents into cohesive solutions

### Current Implementation Example

Based on the DeepCode Editor project structure:

```typescript
// AgentOrchestrator.ts - Advanced Multi-Agent Coordination
export class AgentOrchestrator {
  private agents: Map<string, BaseSpecializedAgent>;
  private activeTasks: Map<string, OrchestratorTask>;

  async processRequest(request: string, context?: AgentContext): Promise<{
    response: string;
    agentResponses: Record<string, AgentResponse>;
    recommendations?: string[];
  }> {
    // Analyze request to determine required agents
    const requiredAgents = this.analyzeRequest(request);
    
    // Process with parallel execution
    const agentResponses: Record<string, AgentResponse> = {};
    for (const agentName of requiredAgents) {
      const agent = this.agents.get(agentName);
      if (agent) {
        const response = await agent.process(request, context);
        agentResponses[agentName] = response;
      }
    }

    // Synthesize responses with conflict resolution
    return this.synthesizeResponses(request, agentResponses, context);
  }
}
```

### Best Practices for 2025

1. **Agent Specialization**: Design agents with specific expertise areas (security, performance, architecture, frontend, backend)
2. **Dynamic Agent Selection**: Use request analysis to automatically determine which agents are needed
3. **Consensus Building**: Implement mechanisms to resolve conflicts between agent recommendations
4. **Context Sharing**: Enable agents to share context and build upon each other's work

## MCP Servers for Development Automation

### Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers have become the backbone for scalable, secure, and agentic application integrations in 2025. They enable AI systems to seamlessly interact with development tools and services.

### Key Architecture Principles

**Tool Design**: Define clear, high-level toolsets rather than mapping every API endpoint to a new MCP tool. Group related tasks into cohesive functions.

**Schema Validation**: Implement strict schema adherence with automated validation to prevent production errors.

**Containerization**: Package MCP servers as Docker containers for consistency across environments.

### Current MCP Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/project/path"]
    },
    "memory": {
      "type": "stdio", 
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    },
    "puppeteer": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer"]
    },
    "github": {
      "type": "stdio",

    description: 'Watch files and run tests automatically',
    triggers: ['file-change', 'git-stage']
  },
  'format-watch': {
    script: 'format-on-save.js', 
    description: 'Watch files and format on save',
    tools: ['prettier', 'eslint-fix']
  },
  'pre-commit': {
    script: 'pre-commit.js',
    description: 'Run comprehensive pre-commit validation',
    checks: ['typescript', 'linting', 'testing', 'security']
  },
  'performance': {
    script: 'performance-monitor.js',
    description: 'Monitor and track performance metrics',
    realTime: true
  }
};
```

### Advanced Hook Patterns

class ResilientAgent {
  async executeWithResilience<T>(
    operation: () => Promise<T>,
    retryConfig: RetryConfig
  ): Promise<T> {
    let lastError: Error;
    
    for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= retryConfig.maxAttempts; attempt++) {
      try {
        return await operation();
      } catch (error) {
        lastError = error;
        
        if (this.isRetryableError(error) && attempt < retryConfig.maxAttempts) {
          await this.delay(retryConfig.backoffMs * Math.pow(2, attempt - 1));
          continue;
        }
        
        throw error;
      }
    }
    
    throw lastError!;
  }
}
```
