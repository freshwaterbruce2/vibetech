- Syntax highlighting for all languages
- Auto-completion and IntelliSense
- Code formatting and folding

### 4. **AI Chat Integration**

- Click **💬 AI Chat** to open assistant panel
- Real DeepSeek API integration with streaming
- Context-aware - AI knows your current file
- Ask questions like:
  - "Explain this code"
  - "How can I improve this function?"
  - "Add error handling"
  - "Write a function that does X"

## 🔧 How to Use

### Step 1: Configure API Key

```bash
1. Open the app
2. Click "⚙️ Settings"
3. Enter your DeepSeek API key (starts with sk-)
4. Click "Save"
```

### Step 2: Create a File

```bash
1. Click "New File"
2. Enter filename (e.g., "app.js")
3. File opens in editor
```

### Step 3: Use AI Assistant

```bash
1. Write some code in the editor
2. Click "💬 AI Chat" button
3. Type your question
4. Press Enter to send
5. AI responds with context about your code
```

## 💡 Example AI Queries

With a JavaScript file open:

- "Add error handling to this function"
- "Convert this to use async/await"
- "Explain what this code does"
- "Optimize this for performance"

With a Python file open:

- "Add type hints to this function"
- "Convert to use list comprehension"
- "Add docstrings"
- "Make this code more Pythonic"

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### API Integration

- Uses DeepSeek Chat API (`deepseek-chat` model)
- Streaming responses for real-time feedback
- Error handling for API failures
- Context includes current file content and language

### Data Persistence

- API key stored in localStorage
- Files stored in component state
- Settings persist across sessions

### UI Features

- VS Code-inspired dark theme
- Responsive layout
- Hover effects and transitions
- Loading states for AI responses

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### API Key Not Working?

1. Ensure key starts with `sk-`
2. Check for extra spaces
3. Verify API credits at platform.deepseek.com

### AI Not Responding?

1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Ensure API key is saved
3. Try refreshing the page

### Files Not Saving?

- Files are stored in memory
- Use browser's localStorage for persistence
- Real file system integration requires Electron

## 🎯 Next Steps

The foundation is complete for:

- Adding more AI features (code completion, refactoring)
- File system integration with Electron
- Git integration
- Terminal support
- Extension system

Your AI-powered code editor is ready to use! 🚀
